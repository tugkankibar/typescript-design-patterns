# TypeScript Design Patterns

## What is it?
This is a repository containing common design pattern implementations in TypeScript.

## Why?
I have been intending to brush up my knowledge on design patterns in general, with my tool-of-choice TypeScript. What better way to do so than to write down some examples in a public repo?

## Wait... I don't get why you wrote it this way!
## I have a suggestion how to make it better.
## Can you explain this?
Sure! Please feel free to open an issue on GitHub and I'd love to have a short chat on it; hopefully both of us gaining some knowledge from this process.
Besides - who doesn't like making friends? ðŸ˜„
